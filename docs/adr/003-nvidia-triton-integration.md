# ADR-003: NVIDIA Triton Inference Server Integration

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The chip quality inspection platform requires high-performance machine learning inference capabilities for real-time defect detection. We need to support multiple model formats (ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch), dynamic batching for throughput optimization, and GPU acceleration for processing high-resolution images efficiently.

## Decision
We will integrate NVIDIA Triton Inference Server as our primary ML inference backend with the following architecture:

### Triton Server Configuration
- **Platform**: Kubernetes deployment with GPU node affinity
- **Model Repository**: Shared storage (NFS/EFS) for model versioning
- **Client Integration**: gRPC clients in Python inference service
- **Batching Strategy**: Dynamic batching with preferred batch sizes [4, 8, 16]
- **GPU Utilization**: Multi-instance groups per GPU for optimal resource usage

### Implementation Details

#### Model Management
```protobuf
# Example model configuration
name: "pcb_defect_detector"
platform: "onnxruntime_onnx"
max_batch_size: 32
dynamic_batching {
  preferred_batch_size: [ 4, 8, 16 ]
  max_queue_delay_microseconds: 500
}
instance_group [
  {
    count: 2
    kind: KIND_GPU
    gpus: [ 0 ]
  }
]
```

#### Performance Optimizations
- **TensorRT Integration**: FP16 precision for 2x speedup
- **Model Ensembles**: Combine preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing
- **Memory Optimization**: Shared memory for large model artifacts
- **Concurrent Execution**: Multiple model instances per GPU

#### Monitoring & Observability
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Request latency, throughput, GPU utilization
- **Health Checks**: Model readiness and liveness probes
- **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration for request tracking
- **Performance Logging**: Inference timing and resource usage

## Consequences

### Positive
- **High Throughput**: Dynamic batching improves GPU utilization by 3-5x
- **Low Latency**: Optimized model serving with <100ms p99 response times
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with multiple Triton instances
- **Model Flexibility**: Support for ONNX, TensorFlow, PyTorch models
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in NVIDIA's own manufacturing
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal GPU memory usage with instance groups

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure component to manage
- **GPU Dependency**: Requires NVIDIA GPU nodes in Kubernetes cluster
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Triton configuration and optimization
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Tight coupling with NVIDIA ecosystem

### Mitigations
- **Fallback Strategy**: CPU-based inference for non-critical workloads
- **Multi-cloud Support**: Abstract Triton behind service interface
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and troubleshooting guides
- **Training**: Team training on Triton optimization and debugging

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Basic Integration (Week 1-2)
- Deploy Triton server on Kubernetes with GPU support
- Implement gRPC client in inference service
- Basic model loading and health checks

### Phase 2: Optimization (Week 3-4)
- Configure dynamic batching and model ensembles
- Implement TensorRT optimization
- Add comprehensive monitoring and alerting

### Phase 3: Production Hardening (Week 5-6)
- Load testing and performance tuning
- Disaster recovery and backup procedures
- Documentation and runbook creation

## Alternatives Considered

### TorchServe
- **Pros**: Native PyTorch support, simpler for PyTorch models
- **Cons**: Limited multi-framework support, less optimized batching
- **Verdict**: Too PyTorch-specific for our multi-framework needs

### TensorFlow Serving
- **Pros**: Mature, well-documented, good TensorFlow integration
- **Cons**: Limited ONNX support, less efficient GPU utilization
- **Verdict**: Framework limitation outweighs benefits

### Custom FastAPI Service
- **Pros**: Full control, simpler deployment
- **Cons**: Manual batching implementation, no built-in optimizations
- **Verdict**: Reinventing the wheel, would take months to match Triton performance

### MLflow Model Serving
- **Pros**: Good MLOps integration, experiment tracking
- **Cons**: Limited high-performance inference capabilities
- **Verdict**: Better for experimentation than production inference

## Success Metrics
- **Throughput**: >500 inferences/second with batch processing
- **Latency**: <50ms p50, <100ms p99 response times
- **GPU Utilization**: >80% during peak load
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with proper health checks
- **Resource Efficiency**: <2GB GPU memory per model instance
