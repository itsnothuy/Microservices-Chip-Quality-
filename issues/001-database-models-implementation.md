## 🚨 Critical Implementation Notes

### TimescaleDB Considerations
- **Hypertables**: Configure for `inspections`, `quality_metrics`, `audit_log` tables
- **Partitioning**: Implement time-based partitioning for performance
- **Retention Policies**: Set up automated data retention for compliance

### Performance Requirements
- **Query Performance**: All queries must complete < 100ms average
- **Connection Efficiency**: Pool utilization should stay < 80%
- **Memory Management**: Proper session cleanup to prevent memory leaks

### Security Requirements
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries exclusively
- **Connection Security**: SSL/TLS for production database connections
- **Audit Compliance**: Every data modification must be logged

### FDA Compliance Requirements
- **Data Integrity**: Immutable audit trails for all quality-related data
- **Electronic Records**: Proper timestamp and user tracking
- **Validation**: All changes must be traceable and validated

This implementation will serve as the foundation for all other platform services and must be production-ready with comprehensive testing and documentation.
