6. **Testing**: pytest with asyncio support and comprehensive fixtures

### Code Organization
```
services/
├── shared/           # Shared libraries (database, auth, events)
├── api-gateway/      # Main API gateway service
├── inspection-svc/   # Inspection business logic
├── inference-svc/    # ML inference service
├── artifact-svc/     # File and artifact management
